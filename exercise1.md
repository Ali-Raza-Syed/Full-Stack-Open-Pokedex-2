For linting in Python, PyFlake8 can be used. It is a combination of three separate linters: PyFlakes, pycodestyle (pep8), and Mccabe. It is able to detect both logical and stylistic lint. For writing tests, we can use unittest, present in Python’s own standard library or we can also go for pytest. For building packages, setuptools can be used. For continuous integration in Python, CircleCI can be used, which is a cloud-based service. Others are available too, like Abstruse CI and Agola. 
Whether to choose self-hosted or cloud-based CI is a context dependent question. There are many up- and down-sides for both of them. Cloud-based CI does not require any hardware or software infrastructure to setup, which means that we do not need worry about updates and patches in it. Additionally, these are also easy to set up. But, the cloud-based platforms’ prices may rise exponentially as our team size increases. Also, these platforms have limited technologies, so if we ever want to change our technology stack, we will first need to check whether our CI cloud-based platform supports it or not.
For self-hosted CI setups, the main advantage is the scalability. Even if self-hosted CI setups do not support some feature out of the box, we can always create some plugin for it ourselves. But then for such setups, we have to take care about its installations and maintenance ourselves which can be its own different thing than development and require additional workforce to take care of it.
